# COVID-19RemoteExams
This project was created during the COVID-19 pandemic.
I am a Computer Science student, who was struggling during studies and exams from home.
So it got me an idea to create a simple exams system that allows students to do exams from home in the best way possible.
It is for school, so it has three types of users: Teachers, Students and Principal.
Each user has his own privilige, for example teacher can create a questions and store them in the data base. Each teacher can use these question(if he teaches the same course) and add them to there exam.
Building an exam is by choosing questions from the database, or uploading a file from the computer.
Each student will get exam code, and when it's time, there will be a timer counting the remaining time.
After the exam is done, the teacher can see the final exam with the solution and give the grade.
Principal can only read exams and questions, access each student grades and courses.
